   On desktop the story paragraphs are wide, which is not reader friendly
   
 - Images / Videos not displayed correctly:
   Images are too large, Videos don't play

 - Turn On/Off cumbersome:
   You have to click onto the extension icon 2x (close and open the Menu) to change the "Turn Off" or "Turn On" button

 - No lazy loading:
